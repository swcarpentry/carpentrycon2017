# Carpentry Con 2017

## Alix Keener and Greg Wilson, October 2016

**Summary:** We propose a task force to organize and run a
get-together for people involved in Software and Data Carpentry in
late May or early June 2017.

## Specific Goals

Organize and run a gathering for the Carpentry community.  Initial
parameters are:

*   Three-day event in late May or early June 2017

*   50-100 people (trainers, maintainers, committee members, other
    instructors, invited guests)

*   No registration fee

*   Participants pay their own travel and accommodation
    *   We'll try to find sponsorship for a few travel support grants

*   Mornings are half-day plenary tutorials, possibly including:
    *   Mark Guzdial/Barbara Ericson on computing education
    *   Raquell Holmes on improv for scientists
    *   Christie Koehler on community organization and non-profit governance
    *   Etc.

*   Afternoons are sessions organized and run by community members, such as:
    *   lesson sprints
    *   demo teaching sessions
    *   intros to new tools

*   Central location in North America with major airport
    *   With a major university where we have friends who can arrange space
    *   Chicago, Ann Arbor, Toronto, ...
    *   Minimize average travel costs from remote locations (esp. EMEA/ANZ)

## Steps to Achieve Goals

2.  Recruit three co-organizers from community.

3.  Draft budget (see below).

4.  Do comparative cost analysis on sites where space can be secured.

5.  Select site.

6.  Invite guest speakers.

7.  Open registration.

8.  ...

9.  Profit.

## Timeline

*   Registration opens Jan 2017.

*   Speakers confirmed by end of Jan 2017.

*   Event occurs late May/early June 2017.

## Assessment

Progress will be measured and reported against the timeline above.
(The organizing committee's first task will be to flesh out the timeline.)

## Community Support

*   Alix Keener is seeking permission to devote time to this.

*   (At least) three other community members will be recruited to assist.
    *   If none come forward, this proposal will be shelved.
